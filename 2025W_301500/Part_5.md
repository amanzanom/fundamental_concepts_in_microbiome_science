# Part 5: Annotate a complex IS element region and discussion
In this part we will go through a quite complex case of multiple nested insertions of mobile elements. This is a section to go through together and discuss.

## IS invasions (Matrix mode 💊🫲 😎 🫱💊)
When working with certain organisms, such as those endosymbionts mentioned in the presentation, mobile elements, including ISs, can get really wild, undergoing quite complex nested insertions.

- For this part we will work with a case of multiple nested insertions of MEs from *Cardinium* bacteria. So, go ahead and download the [`IS_invasion.gb`](./data/IS_invasion.gb) (right click 🖱️ and download).

- Drag the downloaded file (`IS_invasion.gb`) into UGENE or open it (Top-left corner `File -> Open`).

- This is how the annotation should look like. Knowing what we know now, and knowing how to go through an annotation file, can you guess the correct order of invasions?

  - Based on the annotation, one can infer the following series of events:
    
    `ISCca2 <- ncRNA(Group II catalytic intron) <- MITE(ISlCca01,reverse),[ISCca4(reverse) <- [ISCca4 <- MITE(ISlCca01)]]`

</details>

We are done! Now you are an expert in annotation of ISs 👍. Thanks for sticking through!
