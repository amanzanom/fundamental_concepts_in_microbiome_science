# Genes on the Move (Fundamental Concepts in Microbiome Science -- 2025W_301500)
This repository contains the exercise section of the *Genes on the Move* lecture. The goal of this exercise is to gain an in‑depth familiarity with insertion sequence (IS) elements, which are among the most common and abundant mobile elements in bacterial and archaeal genomes.

## Overview and Project Description
This exercise will consist of four different parts:
1. Part 1: Introduction to IS elements
2. Part 2: ISfinder database
3. Part 3: Annotation of a "typical" IS element (together)
4. Part 4: Annotate your own IS elements (independent)
5. Part 5: Annotate a complex IS element region and discussion
