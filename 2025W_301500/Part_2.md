# Part 2: ISfinder database
ISfinder is a large centralised database of IS elements of Bacteria and Archaea. It also serves as a valuable resource for annotation of similar and related IS elements to those in the database. In fact, popular annotation pipelines, such as [Prokka](https://github.com/tseemann/prokka) or [Bakta](https://github.com/oschwengers/bakta?tab=readme-ov-file#database), use this database to make predictions on open reading frames (or predicted proteins).
